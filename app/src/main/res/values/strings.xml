    <string name="affirmation1Broad">Let me begin with some congratulations. First, to Paschal on his re-election as Eurogroup President. Over the last two and a half years he has shown how he was capable to lead this group and to address difficult and challenging situations. He entered the Eurogroup during the pandemic, and has since weathered many crises, contributing to our collective delivery of strong policy responses at a time of unprecedented challenges. And I am convinced that we will continue in this same spirit as we face the challenges ahead.\nI would also like to warmly congratulate Pierre on his election as Managing Director of the ESM. Pierre brings tremendous experience to this important role, having been for over 7 years a member of the Eurogroup, where he showed his great ability to build bridges. I am certain we will work very effectively together.\nMacroeconomic developments\nOn the economic outlook, our economic forecast presented only one month ago is still solid.\n
 Survey data are confirming our estimations that we will have a couple of quarters of contraction in winter and that growth will remain subdued next year.\n
Second, the external environment, meaning the global situation, looks to be weakening further.\n
Third, our forecast for inflation was confirmed by recent data. Our forecast was that inflation was peaking in this end of 2022, but we should be in any case very cautious and aware that decline will only be very gradual next year.\n
Fourth, the bright spot in the outlook is that labour markets remain very robust. Of course our strong policy response during the pandemic, including the SURE programme, has contributed to this. But we know that labour markets are reacting to crises with different timings, so we should continue to monitor this.\n

Draft budgetary plans\nThe level of success you see in your life is a direct result of your belief system. I’m not talking about religion or philosophy here. What I mean is your belief in your ability to succeed. Believing in yourself means having faith in your own capabilities. It means believing that you CAN do something — that it is within your ability. When you believe in yourself, you can overcome self-doubt and have</string>

Draft budgetary plans\nIf there is an opportunity somewhere you should take advantage of it (jump at the chance). If someone offers to pay your college fees take that opportunity.

    <string name="affirmation4Broad">Life is full of struggle. Sometimes it seems as if you can’t catch a break. Everything is going against you. Only if you had been born taller, richer, more handsome, or stronger, then things could have been easier. Unfortunately, you got what you were dealt and there is no use in fretting about it. You have to work with what you got. However not everything depends on luck. There are many things that you can do to </string>
    <string name="affirmation5Broad">If you write the phrase without a verb then people will most probably understand what you are saying, but it is a fragment (ie an incomplete sentence). If you are speaking informally you can use fragments (they’re like a form of verbal shorthand), but by adding the verb you make things clearer and it is better English. (The fragment hides who it is that has so much to be thankful for. Using a verb clarifies this.)</string>

Even though that is what society tells us being strong means, being strong actually means having the faith in hard times, but still allowing yourself to feel how you feel. Being strong means having the courage to admit that you aren’t okay. Being strong means being able to talk</string>
